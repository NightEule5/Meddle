# Meddle

Meddle (**Med**ia **d**own**l**oad**e**r) is a work-in-progress project for downloading and storing content from various sources, like YouTube videos.

## Disclaimer

In light of the still fairly recent false [DMCA takedown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl#RIAA_takedown_request) of youtube-dl by the RIAA, I'll note that this project, like youtube-dl, is not intended for malicious purposes such as copyright infringement. Rather, its intended use is for cases where content is needed for incorporation into [Fair Use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) works, or for archival. I don't condone nor encourage misuse of this project to infringe on others' intellectual property.
